Attached is a text file containing data from an airborne instrument NASA flew
during the DISCOVER-AQ field mission.
The instrument is a spectrometer called ACAM which measures the column density
for different trace gases.
The attached file contains the VCD (vertical column density) and a derived
boundary layer mixing ratio for NO2.
I have a presentation with OAQPS on November 11th to discuss the DISCOVER-AQ
mission and would like to see if you can put in a hack to include this data
so I can show it overlaid with CMAQ surface NO2 and ground NO2 data for the
Baltimore area.
We have 12 days of flight data.
Can you please let me know how hard it is to put this into RSIG3D?

Time (UTC),Lat,Lon,VCD,Mixing Ratio (ppbv)
14.12,39.696,-75.868,4.45E+15,-9999
13.2115,37.0532,-77.048,5.63E+15,-9999

13.2127,37.0282,-77.0558,5.66E+15,-9999

Solution:
1. Convert the files to the format input by SiteSubset:

printf temp_file "%9s,%9.4f,%9.4f,%04d,%03d,%04.1f,%8.1f,%46s\n",
       $site, $latitude, $longitude,
       $year, $day_of_year, $hour,
       $measurement, $city;

SITE,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,YEAR,JUL_DAY,GMT_HR,ozone,ppb,SITE_NAME
220870002,  29.9819, -89.9986,2001,238,00.5,    34.0,                                 Not in a city

and save the files in /data/ACAM/data/20140722_no2.txt, vcd.

2. Create acamserver with COVERAGE=no2,vcd and invoke SiteSubset on the files.

Todd,
 
Can you please replace the ACAM files that you “hacked in” with these updated files.  These ACAM files contain updated concentration calculations.   Also attached is a separate set of files “date_HSRLML_....txt”   These files contain a mixing height derived from lidar aerosol vertical profiles which was flown on the same place as the ACAM instrument.  HSRL is the High Spectral Resolution Lidar.   Could you also hack in these files?
 
The parameter is “mixing height” or ML in magl.  The data set should be under aircraft and be HSRL.  The orginial meeting with OAQPS to show some of this was moved to Dec 11.   Any chance you’ll be able to hack in the HSRL data by then?

Done. Replaced previous NO2 and VCD files, added mixing_ratio(m).

Reorganized, renamed and reformatted csv input files.
See newest script, convert_new_files
Rewrote acamserver and hsrlserver to use new reformatted files and
output new 'Point' XDR format (instead of 'SITE') format.
