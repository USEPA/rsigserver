This directory contains the C source code for the CMAQSubset program.
Note that this application requires linking with libUtilities.a
(whose source code is at ../../lib/Utilities) and libNetCDF.a
(../../lib/NetCDF).


Files:
------

README             - This file.
CMAQDataset.c      - C source file for CMAQDataset ADT.
CMAQDataset.h      - C header file for CMAQDataset ADT.
CMAQSubset.c       - C source file for CMAQSubset program (has main())
makeit             - C Shell script to compile the program.
subset.xdr         - Sample output file of a subset.


Compiling:
----------

Run 'makeit' to compile the program.

set uname_ = "`uname`"
set uname_m = "`uname -m`"
set platform = "$uname_"
if ( "$uname_" == "Linux" ) set platform = "$uname_.$uname_m"
echo "platform is $platform"


Running and Program Usage Documentation:
----------------------------------------

For CMAQSubset program usage documentation simply execute 
../../../bin/$platform/CMAQSubset |& more
to see what command-line options are required/available and
the format of the resulting output files.

See 'runit' script for examples.

Notes:
------

1. CONC and MET grids match, DOT grids are related but not matched.
   GRIDCRO2D files define LON LAT HT (meters above mean sea level)
             of grid cell centers.
   GRIDCRO3D files define X3HT0M (cell center meters above ground).
   CONC files define air-quality variables such as NO and O3.
   MET  files define temperature, TA (K), etc. and possibly changing
        grid cell centers ZH (meters above ground)
        and WWIND (m/s vertical wind at top-center of cell).
   GRIDDOT2D defines LON LAT of wind.
   METDOT3D  defines UWIND, VWIND (horizontal wind components, m/s)

I couldn't find HT and ZH for the DOT grid files.

2. Use 'head' to examine the headers of the binary output files:

head -17 subset.xdr
