This directory contains the C source code for the GASPSubset program used
to subset data files from:
http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/FIRE/GASP/gasp.html

It uses the ZLIB library:
../../libs/zlib
../../../lib/$platform/libz.a

Files:
------

README       - This file.
GASPSubset.c - C source file for GASPSubset program (has main())
makeit       - C Shell script to compile the program.
runit        - C Shell script to illustrate running the program.
testit       - C Shell script to test the program.
testdata/    - Directory containing test data files.
subset.xdr   - Sample output file of a subset.


Compiling:
----------

Run 'makeit' to compile the program with assertions-checking and debugging (-g).
Run 'makeit optimized' to create an optimized executable (no assertions, -O).
After running 'makeit', the executable is in ../../../bin/$platform/GASPSubset
where $platform is determined by the following C Shell commands:

set uname_ = "`uname`"
set uname_m = "`uname -m`"
set platform = "$uname_"
if ( "$uname_" == "Linux" ) set platform = "$uname_.$uname_m"
echo "platform is $platform"


Running and Program Usage Documentation:
----------------------------------------

For GASPSubset program usage documentation simply execute 
../../../bin/$platform/GASPSubset |& more
to see what command-line options are required/available and
the format of the resulting output files.

See 'runit' script for examples.


Notes:
------

1. The sample input data file is
   testdata/2008174231515_i16_US.all.aod.gz

2. Use 'head' to examine the headers of the binary output files:

head -15 subset.xdr


Plans for the next release:
---------------------------

1. TBD.
