Hi, Todd, 

GASP and GASP-WEST data have been replaced by GOES-R AOD.
Now GOES-16 is GOES-East and GOES-17 is GOES-West.
We are now providing near-real-time data from GOES-East (GOES-16) at
ftp://ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/hzhang/GOES-16/NRT/

You can find the lat-lon information at
ftp://ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/hzhang/GOES-16/sample_aod/latlon_files_updated/

Thanks,
