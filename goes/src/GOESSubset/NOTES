Hello Todd,

I have placed some sample data on our ftp server for you to test (links below).
File 2013.tar contains one week of GOES retrievals from
September 1, 2013 through September 7, 2013.

By un-tarring this file you will get a set of daily compressed tar files.
This is how you will see the files we archive.
Basically, the directory tree for our archives is:

YYYY/gp_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz 

Meaning that under each year,
you will find a compressed tar file for each day of the year
(YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the day).
Un-compressing and un-tarring each daily file
will provide you with a set of hourly files for each variable (product).
The convention for the file names is:

goes_Sensor_Product_Version_YYYYMMDDHHMMZ.txt

Where "Sensor" is either "img" for Imager or "snd" for Sounder,
"Product" stands for the variable retrieved, and
"Version" indicates the retrieval version (currently set to "v00").
Products are:
INSL (incident radiation at the surface, insolation in W/m^2)
CALB (cloud albedo, % 0-100)
SALB (surface albedo, % 0-100)
CTP  (cloud top pressure, Pa)
LWIR (IR temperature, degrees K)
TSKN (surface skin temperature, degrees K)
TPW  (total precipitable water, mm)
PARW (Photosynthetically Active Radiation, PAR, W/m^2)
PARM (Photosynthetically Active Radiation, PAR, micro-mol/m^2/s)
-999.0 denotes missing value.

CTP and LWIR are produced from both Imager and Sounder measurements.

The other two links are the geolocation files for Imager and Sounder products.
The area of coverage and the resolution for each sensor is fixed.

Here are the links:

Please let me know if you have any question.

Best.

Arastoo and Dick,
 
Would you have time available this afternoon between 2-5 pm for a call to
discuss bringing some of the UAH data sets into RSIG?
Iâ€™m at EPA this week, so Todd, Matt and I can get together to call you.
 
Jim
