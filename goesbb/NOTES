Heidi,

I talked with Fred about a week ago about the potential to bring daily
biomass burning emissions data into RSIG.  The only organization I know
that is producing a daily product on a routine basis in NOAA/NESDIS.
While we know there are uncertainties associated with the emissions,
this data set can be a valuable addition to RSIG. We have an informal
requested into NESDIS for this to be an operational product and will be
putting in a formal request.

One of the potential applications within RSIG based on the data sets
(current and planned) is to develop an application for looking a biomass
impacts on PM2.5.  To start can you have someone pull these files down
to RTP and bring them into RSIG as another data layer.  Would it also be
possible to modify the RSIG data architecture diagrams to reflect the
inclusion of this data set?   Once the product moves to an operational
environment at NESDIS we can work with them to figure out the best way
to get the data on a daily basis.

Also another data set we should be working to get is the MOPITT CO data
set from Langley's DAAC.  We can talk about this at a future RSIG call.

Fred - Do you have any additional comments/thoughts?

Thanks,
Jim



Jim,

Please find attached two papers (one submitted to RSE and one to be
submitted to AE) and ftp link for the near real time data for daily
pull.

ftp://ftp.orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/xzhang/PM25

Thank you so much for your assistance in all this.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Regards,

Shobha

================(10/11/06)
  1. Hourly emission data
The near real time PM2.5 emissions released from biomass burning are produced.
Particularly, the emission in the previous date is calculated for every half hour and aggregated to hourly data.
The results are kept in two files. The jpg image file provides daily cumulative emissions,
which gives a visualization of the spatial pattern in emissions.
The ASCII file includes hourly data with the following items:

Year day longitude latitude PM2.5_h1 PM2.5_h2 PM2.5_h3 PM2.5_h4 PM2.5_h5 PM2.5_h6 PM2.5_h7
PM2.5_h8 PM2.5_h9 PM2.5_h10 PM2.5_h11 PM2.5_h12 PM2.5_h13 PM2.5_h14 PM2.5_h15 PM2.5_h16 PM2.5_h17
PM2.5_h18 PM2.5_h19 PM2.5_h20 PM2.5_h21 PM2.5_h22 PM2.5_h23 PM2.5_h24 Eco

The PM2.5_h1-- PM2.5_h24 indicates hourly emission (kg).
Eco is the ecosystem type.

Regarding the file name, here are the examples:
f2006270_emis_hourly----ASCII file for emission data. The first four digits in the file name are the year (2006), 
and the following three digits are the day of year (270). In other words, the file name indicates the date of emission data.

f2006270_emis_lalon.jpg----a jpg image. The digits are the same as above.

  2. Parameters in the model of  PM2.5 emissions
Fuel loading is developed from MODIS vegetation properties at a spatial resolution of 1km. The MODIS data 
include vegetation continuous fields (percent cover), land cover type, and vegetation leaf index.
Fuel moisture is derived from weekly AVHRR vegetation condition index, which controls combustion factor 
and emission factor.
GOES fire size data are used as a proxy of burned area. Specifically, based on available GOES fire size data, 
we generate a set of reprehensive curves of the diurnal fire sizes using a Fourier model for various ecosystems. 
The reprehensive curves are used to assimilate the fire size for each burned pixel detected from GOES fire product. 
Thus, the fire size is used as a proxy of burned area for estimating biomass burning emissions.

Heidi,
 

You might have seen my e-mail to Shobha where NOAA/NESDIS plans to make the GOES BB emission product operational.  This will likely take place over the next month or so, and as a result NCDC will begin to archive the product.  So sometime in late July or August I would like to make a trip to NCDC and talk with them about hosting the sub-setting routine on their servers for this product.  This will be a good test case because NOAA will have NO2 total column products from OMI and GOME-2 that will likely reside at NCDC along with the GOES AOD product and others in the future.

 

In the mean time can we update GOES files on the RSIG system so we have an updated archive?  These files are small so I hope this isn't a problem.  I think the location is for the files is ftp://ftp.orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/xzhang/PM25/.  It would be good to have these update for the demo next Tuesday, so we can show emission estimates from this product for the Eastern NC/VA fires this month.  Please let me know if this is doable?
 

Thanks,

Jim
