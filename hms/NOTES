Todd and Matt,
 
Can you look at this NOAA ftp site,
ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/FIRE/HMS/GIS/
and let me know how difficult it would be to start including the
HMS_fire locations hms_fireYYYYMMDD.dbf
and HMS_smoke hms_smokeYYYYMMDD.shp/shx/dbf
in RSIG?
They produce the files in various formats twice a day,
so the final files are the ones we would use.
If we can setup an ftp pull for this and add this data without much effort,
this would be good.

For the ecosys classification codes seen in the dbf file you indicate,
I am pretty sure, but not certain, that the ecosystem code is from
the attached file.
I know that we use that for the text files that we generate but
I'm not positive that it's the same for the GIS file
(one would think they should be the same).
I will check with our programmer to verify.

For the sensor identification, it's not in the dbf file but
it is in the text file
ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/FIRE/HMS/hms20161012.txt
and also in the kml files
ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/FIRE/HMS/KML/
Don't ask me why the information isn't the same in all the file formats.
It's a legacy issue that we should probably resolve someday.

The density in the smoke files represents smoke concentration
in ug/m3 and is one of 3 values (5, 16 or 27) that roughly
correspond to light, medium and dense smoke.
These shouldn't be considered as exact values fro the smoke
concentration within the plume but rather a rough estimate a
range of values.
It's better to view these as relative densities within the plume.
The smoke plumes are also available in kml format if that's useful for you.
Hope this is helpful. Let me know if you need more.

Mark

For fire point locations, we only need to dbf files:

dbfdump hms_fire20161017.dbf | head

Subject: GOES-16 in HMS

Season's greeting from the HMS Team! As we approach a new year we will be incorporating a new satellite into the Hazard Mapping System (HMS). GOES-16 was launched about a year ago and has been undergoing extensive checkout. It was declared to be the operational GOES-EAST satellite on December 18, with an overlap period with GOES-13 until January 3. We are planning on switching from GOES-13 to GOES-16 data for GOES-EAST coverage in the HMS on Thursday December 28. For the HMS analysis on the 28th we will only use GOES-16. It will be listed as GOES-EAST in the output files, just as GOES-13 has been. Beginning on the 28th we will incorporate the GOES-16 automated fire detections (from the Fire Detection and Characterization (FDC) algorithm) into the HMS for the analysts to evaluate. As with all other automated satellite fire products, image analysts will remove those occurrences potentially associated with a false detection and add new ones into the HMS product where fires may have been omitted. However, it should be noted that the un-inspected FDC data will not yet be made available via our website (http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/fire.html) since the FDC algorithm is not yet operational. This is expected to occur later in 2018.
The GOES-16 imagery represents a new generation of satellite capability with higher temporal and spatial resolution. Nominal resolution of the 4um shortwave IR band (used for fire detection) is 2 km compared to 4 km for the previous GOES satellites. Imagery within the CONUS area of coverage will typically update every 5 minutes while data from the Full Disk area of coverage (such as over most of Canada) will typically update every 15 minutes. The FDC data are not currently available in the mesoscale scanning mode (i.e., 1000´1000km sub-regions imaged at up to 30sec interval). 

The GOES-16 data will be included in the HMS text files as follows:

Lon,     Lat,    YearDay, Time,       Satellite,       Method of Detect, Ecosys, Fire RadPower

-119.130,  34.550, 2017352, 1005,      MODIS AQUA,           MODIS,     22,       35.963303
-82.480,  28.360, 2017352, 1447,         GOES-EAST,                    FDC,    31,    -999.000000
-81.130,  26.860, 2017352, 1447,         GOES-EAST,                    FDC,    31,    -999.000000

Please note that the ‘Method of detect’ reflects the new name of the algorithm (FDC) for the automatically detected fires as opposed to the previous ABBA for GOES-13. Please also note that, as with previous GOES satellites, Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is only available for those detections marked with a fire mask class of 5 (‘processed’), 3 (‘high probability’), and 4 (‘medium probability’).
The GOES-16 data will similarly be incorporated into the kml and GIS shapefiles as well.



Real-time GOES-East imagery has been posted to our web site at http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/FIRE/sat_east.html  However, GOES-16 imagery will not be available on our web page. GOES-13 imagery will continue to be available on this site until it is turned off on January 3. After January 3, users are requested to access GOES-16 imagery from  https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php
If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to contact us at either:  john.simko@noaa.gov  or  SSDFireTeam@noaa.gov
