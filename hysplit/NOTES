Todd,

I just looked over my steps over how data was processed. There are multiple steps involved,  but in the first steps I had to multiply by   *1000000000 to convert the units into ug/m3.  Your email reminded me that there was some unit conversion. The units must have been in ug/cm3

I think that may have to be done to the concentrations you have.
