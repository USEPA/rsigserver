Q1. Do we only handle L2 files?

At this point, YES

Q2. Below are the L2 file ‘types’.
Please decode the letters. Presumably they specify the variables contained?

2nd and 4th letter are key for this purpose. Last number is just a version control number.

_L2_rfuh5

Formaldehyde and horizontal

_L2_rfus5

Formaldehyde and synthetic (direct)


_L2_rnvh3

NO2 and horizontal

_L2_rnvs3

NO2 and sythetic (direct)

_L2_rnvss

(?) does this exists

_L2_rout2

Ozone and theoretical (direct)

_L2_rsus1

SO2 and synthetic (direct)

_L2Tot_rnvs0

No2 and synthetic, v0

_L2Tot_rnvs1

No2 and synthetic, v1

_L2Tot_rout0

ozone and theoretical, v0

_L2Trop_rnvh1

No2 and horizontal, v1


Below are sample columns.
Q3. Are columns consistent across file types?

No. There are overlap but not always

Q4. Which columns do we want to handle in pandoraserver?

Will answer on call or in follow up

Q5. Are units consistent?

Yes, across p-1-X. (1.7 is different from 1.8, but I’m guessing will be constant after 1.8)

Q6. Are ‘missing values’ consistent?

Should be, I would think

Q7. For each column we want to process, what are its valid range?
