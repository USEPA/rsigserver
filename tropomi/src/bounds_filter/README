It uses the following external libraries: netcdf4 hdf5_hl hdf5 curl z
and Standard C libraries: dl m c.
To compile: ./makeit

Files:
------
README - This file.
*.[hc] - C source files for the program.
makeit - C Shell script to compile the program.


Running and Program Usage Documentation:
----------------------------------------
For bounds_filter program usage documentation simply execute 
bounds_filter |& more
to see what command-line options are required/available and
the format of the resulting output files.


Notes:
------
The bounds_filter program is invoked by the C-Shell listfiles program
to check that the file bounds intersect the user-specified BBOX.
If so, it prints the file name.
Use the ncdump utility (from NetCDF library) to examine an input file:
ncdump TEMPO_NO2_L2_V01_20231017T111336Z_S001G01.nc | more
